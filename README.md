> ### Next.js + React Query codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Next.js** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Next.js** community styleguides & best practices.
